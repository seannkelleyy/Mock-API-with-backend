# Mock-API-with-backend

This project is a simple C# Entity Framework backend that creates API endpoints that can be used to get data from Microsofts Adventure Works mock database.
This was primarily used as a learning tool to get more practice building a Hexagonal Architectd backend using EFCore and C#.

To get started, simply clone the repo to Visual Studio and hit the play button to run it.
